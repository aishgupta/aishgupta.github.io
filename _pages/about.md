Hi, I am Aishwarya Gupta, first year PhD scholar at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). Before joining the PhD program, I have worked as a Research Engineer in Computer Vision and Media Analytics Team for two years at [Conduent Labs India](https://www.conduent.com/innovation/conduent-labs/conduent-labs-india/)(previously known as Xerox Research Center India). While working at Conduent Labs India, I got an opportunity to work on some of the real world challenges (especially in the transport sector) and have contributed to the following projects: Vehicle Passenger Detection System, Remaining Utility Life(a research thread of the project Vehicle Health Monitoring) and Vehicle Re-Identification.

I have completed M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/), India where I worked on learning probabilistic models for multi-label learning problem via graph embeddings. I also worked on leveraging the label co-occurrence matrix for learning the probabilistic model for zero-shot multi-label learning problem.
