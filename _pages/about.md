Hi, I am Aishwarya Gupta, PhD scholar at [IIT Kanpur, India](https://www.iitk.ac.in/). Before joining the PhD program, I have worked as a Research Engineer in Computer Vision and Media Analytics Team at [Conduent Labs India](https://www.conduent.com/innovation/conduent-labs/conduent-labs-india/)(previously known as Xerox Research Center India) tackling some of the underlying real world challenges in the transport sector. I have mainly contributed to the research projects: Vehicle Passenger Detection System, Remaining Utility Life(a research thread of the project Vehicle Health Monitoring) and Vehicle Re-Identification.

I have completed M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/), India. I worked on multi-label learning problem for zero-shot setting and learned novel probabilistic models by leveraging the label co-occurence statistics. I did my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from [HBTU, India](https://hbtu.ac.in/) where I spend the most memorable days of my life with some of the most amazing persons I have met so far.
